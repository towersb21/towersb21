- 👋 Hi, I’m @towersb21
- 👀 I’m interested in python application coding, gmail, and smtp.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use OAUTH2 with OpenID Connect for my Gmail Client application...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ways to change my Python GMAIL Client to login with complete access privileges to one of my GMAIL accounts to read mail.
- 📫 How to reach me is through my email address of bob.towers21@gmail.com.  I have a hearing problem and prefer using email to communicate.
